## Key Technical Decisions

- Breaking down the task list implementation into smaller, focused issues
- Server-side filtering for better performance with large files
- Svelte 5's runes for reactive state management
- shadcn-svelte for accessible UI components with consistent styling
- Enhanced timestamp handling with OrgDatetime structure
- Focus on external editor integration rather than built-in editing
- Implemented file monitoring with debouncing for efficient change detection
- Used `once_cell` for thread-safe singleton pattern in the file monitor
- **Document lookup pattern** using Map<string, OrgDocument> for efficient multi-document access
- **Clean data architecture** eliminating HeadlineWithDocument interface in favor of existing document_id references
- **Visual document distinction** using hash-based color coding for document badges
