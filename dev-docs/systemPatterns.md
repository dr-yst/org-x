```

- **Frontend**: Svelte 5 + TypeScript for UI, state management with runes
- **Backend**: Rust + Tauri for file parsing, processing, and system operations
- **Type Definition Sharing**: tauri-specta for type synchronization

### Data Flow
- Org files → Orgize Parser → Structured Data → Tauri Commands → UI Display
- External editor changes → File change detection → Re-parsing → UI update

## Key Component Design

### Backend Components
- **Org Parser Module**: Parses org-mode files using Orgize, extracting structured data
- **File System Module**: Monitors files for changes, handles file operations
- **External Integration Module**: Integrates with external editors
- **Global Metadata Manager**: Tracks tags, categories across all documents
- **Settings Manager**: Manages user preferences and application settings using Tauri Store plugin
- **File Monitor Manager**: Handles dynamic file and directory monitoring based on user settings
- **Path Validation Module**: Validates monitoring paths and handles path-related errors

### Frontend Components
- **Core UI Components**: Document viewers, headline hierarchy, content renderers
- **Task List View**: HeadlinesList component with shadcn-svelte Table integration
- **ViewModel Layer**: Store-based state management with business logic separation (MVVM pattern)
- **View Components**: List, Kanban, Timeline implementations (Kanban and Timeline deferred to post-MVP)
- **Interaction Components**: Keyboard shortcuts, command palette
- **Filtering and Organization**: Tag filtering, category management, date-based filtering

## UI Patterns

### Task List View Pattern
- shadcn-svelte Table as the primary display for tasks
- Collapsible headline hierarchy with proper indentation
- Table columns for TODO status, title, tags, and dates
- Keyboard navigation and row selection functionality
- Date-based and status-based filtering

### Multi-View Tab System (Post-MVP)
- Horizontal tabs for different saved views
- Each view maintains separate filter, sort, group settings
- Views persist across sessions

### Sidebar-Based Filtering
- Direct filtering in sidebar with multiple categories:
  - FILES, TAGS, CATEGORIES, TODO KEYWORDS, User-defined properties
- Checkbox-based selection with "All | None" toggles

### Multi-Criteria Sorting
- Multiple sort fields (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Sort by title, priority, TODO status, dates, custom properties
- Ascending/descending options

### Flexible Grouping
- Group by TODO status, priority, tags, categories, properties, dates
- Collapsible groups with visual separation
- Nested grouping support

## Data Model

### Core Data Structures
- **OrgDocument**: Represents an org-mode file with metadata and content
- **OrgHeadline**: Represents a headline with hierarchical relationships
- **OrgTitle**: Structured representation of headline titles with properties, tags, TODO status
- **OrgPlanning**: Contains scheduled, deadline, and closed timestamps
- **OrgDatetime/OrgTimestamp**: Enhanced date handling with filtering capabilities
- **TodoStatus/Configuration**: TODO keyword representation and management
- **ViewConfig**: Configuration for saved views with display settings
- **FilterConfig/SortConfig/GroupConfig**: Filtering, sorting, grouping definitions
- **GlobalMetadata**: Cross-document tag and category tracking

### Settings Data Structures
- **UserSettings**: Main settings container with monitored paths and parse overrides
- **MonitoredPath**: Represents a file or directory to monitor with type, recursion, and enabled state
- **ParseOverride**: Per-file override for whether to parse specific org files
- **PathType**: Enum distinguishing between File and Directory monitoring types
- **SettingsManager**: Handles persistence and CRUD operations for settings using Tauri Store

### Data Flow Between Backend and Frontend
- Backend maintains Rust instances of data structures
- Data serialized via tauri-specta when sent to frontend
- Frontend receives separate JavaScript/TypeScript object instances
- Changes require explicit synchronization through Tauri commands
- Settings changes are immediately persisted to Tauri Store for atomic updates
- File monitoring configuration updates require restart of monitoring service

## Design Patterns
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Pattern**: Primary architectural pattern for complex UI components
  - **Model**: Backend Rust structs and TypeScript types (generated by tauri-specta)
  - **ViewModel**: Svelte store modules containing all business logic, Tauri backend calls, and derived state
  - **View**: Pure presentational Svelte components that subscribe to store state and dispatch actions
- **Component Patterns**: Container/Presentational pattern, composition
- **Communication**: Event-based, props for parent-child, context for deeply nested
- **State Management**: Svelte 5 runes (signals, computed, effects) for reactive state
- **Store-Driven Architecture**: All business logic, backend calls, and derived state reside in ViewModel stores
- **Singleton Pattern**: For global metadata management and file monitoring
- **Rendering Patterns**: Virtual lists, lazy-loading for performance
- **Component Library**: shadcn-svelte for consistent UI components
- **Styling System**: Tailwind CSS for utility-based styling
- **View-Tab Pattern**: Independent configuration state per tab
- **Filter-Sort-Group Pattern**: Sequential data processing pipeline
- **Settings Persistence Pattern**: Atomic updates with immediate persistence using Tauri Store
- **Path Validation Pattern**: Comprehensive validation with graceful error handling
- **Monitoring Configuration Pattern**: Dynamic path management with live monitoring updates

## Server-Side Filtering Implementation
- **Implementation**: Filtering, sorting, and grouping logic in Rust
- **Data Flow**: Frontend sends configurations, backend returns filtered results
- **Current Features**:
  - Date-based filtering (today, this week, overdue)
  - TODO status filtering
  - Basic property and tag filtering
- **Benefits**: Reduced data transfer, better performance, lower browser memory usage
- **Future Considerations**: Partial loading, virtualization, pagination, caching

## Task List View Architecture (MVVM Implementation)
- **MVVM Structure**:
  - **Model**: OrgDocument, OrgHeadline types from backend via tauri-specta
  - **ViewModel**: `listview.store.ts` containing all business logic and state management
    - Document loading and refresh logic
    - Filtering logic (today, week, overdue, all)
    - Focus management and keyboard navigation state
    - Quick actions and UI state (detail view, quick look, etc.)
    - Derived state: filteredHeadlines, documentCount, headlineCount
  - **View**: ListView.svelte and HeadlinesList.svelte as pure presentation layers
- **Component Structure**:
  - ListView.svelte: Main presentational component subscribing to store state
  - HeadlinesList.svelte: Table component receiving filtered data from store
  - shadcn-svelte Table: Core UI component for displaying tasks
  - Filter controls: Button-based filtering interface dispatching to store
  - Badge components: For displaying tags, dates, and TODO status
- **Data Flow**:
  - Store handles all Tauri command calls and business logic
  - Store provides derived state through reactive subscriptions
  - Views subscribe to store state and dispatch actions to store
  - User interactions trigger store actions, not direct state mutations
- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  - Row selection with up/down keys managed by store
  - Expand/collapse functionality for parent headlines
  - Focus indicators for keyboard accessibility
  - All navigation state centralized in ViewModel

## File Monitoring & Settings Architecture
- **Settings Management**:
  - UserSettings structure containing monitored paths and parse overrides
  - Tauri Store plugin for cross-platform settings persistence
  - Atomic updates with immediate persistence to prevent data loss
- **Monitoring Configuration**:
  - MonitoredPath supports both individual files and directories
  - Recursive directory monitoring with org file filtering
  - Per-file parse overrides for granular control
- **Integration Patterns**:
  - Settings-driven file monitoring with graceful fallback to hardcoded paths
  - Directory scanning with hidden file/folder exclusion
  - Real-time monitoring updates without application restart
- **Validation & Error Handling**:
  - Path existence validation before adding to monitoring
  - Type validation (file vs directory) with clear error messages
  - Orphaned parse override cleanup when monitored paths are removed

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions, workflow validation
- **Keyboard Tests**: Shortcut verification, navigation testing
